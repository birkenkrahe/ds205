You will learn:

- How to nest ~if~ statements
- How to stack ~if~ statements with ~else if~
- How to pick statements with ~switch~

Download the *raw codealong file* from [[http://tinyurl.com/R-switch-codealong][tinyurl.com/R-switch-codealong]]
and save it as ~switch.org~.

* Nesting and stacking

- An ~if~ statement can be placed within the outcome of another ~if~
  statement: by /nesting/ or /stacking/ conditional statements, you can
  design specific decision-making patterns.

* Example: nesting

- In pseudocode notation:
  #+begin_example
  IF a <= mynumber
     assign `a^2` to a
     IF mynumber > 3
        assign `seq(1,a,length=mynumber)` to b
     ELSE
        assign `a * mynumber` to b
  ELSE
     assign `a-3.5` to a
     IF mynumber >= 4
        assign `a^(3-mynumber)` to b
     ELSE
        assign `rep(a + mynumber, times=3)` to b
  #+end_example

- Nesting different statements for two variables ~a~ and ~mynumber~ (Note
  that this code block on its own will not run because the variables
  are unknown.)
  #+name: nested
  #+begin_src R :results silent
    if(a <= mynumber) {
      cat("First condition was TRUE\n")
      a <- a^2
      if(mynumber > 3) {
        cat("Second condition was TRUE\n")
        b <- seq(1,a,length=mynumber)
      } else {
        cat("Second condition was FALSE\n")
        b <- a * mynumber
      }
    } else {
      cat("First condition was FALSE\n")
      a <- a - 3.5
      if(mynumber >= 4) {
        cat("Second condition was TRUE\n")
        b <- a^(3-mynumber)
      } else {
        cat("Second condition was FALSE\n")
        b <- rep(a + mynumber, times=3)
      }
    }
    a
    b
  #+end_src

- Run this code with ~a <- 3~ and ~mynumber <- 4:~ [fn:1]
  #+begin_src R
    a <- 3
    mynumber <- 4
    <<nested>>
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : First condition was TRUE
  : Second condition was TRUE
  : [1] 9
  : [1] 1.000000 3.666667 6.333333 9.000000

- Reset ~a <- 6~ and ~mynumber <- 4~ and run the nested statements
  again. This time the first condition is not met but the second is,
  and ~b~ is computed with the new value of ~a~:
  #+begin_src R
    a <- 6
    mynumber <- 4
    <<nested>>
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : First condition was FALSE
  : Second condition was TRUE
  : [1] 2.5
  : [1] 0.4

* Example: stacking

- You can stack ~if~ statements by placing a new ~if~ immediately after an
  ~else~ declaration:

- In pseudocode notation:
  #+begin_example
  IF a <= mynumber AND mynumber > 3
     assign `a^2` to a
     assign `seq(1,a,length=mynumber)` to b
  ELSE IF a <= mynumber AND mynumber <= 3
     assign `a^2` to a
     assign `a * mynumber` to b
  ELSE IF a > mynumber AND mynumber >= 4
     assign `a-3.5` to a
     assign `a^(3-mynumber)` to b
  ELSE
     assign `a-3.5` to a
     assign `rep(a + mynumber, times=3)` to b
  #+end_example

- In R code:
  #+name: stacked
  #+begin_src R :results silent
    if (a <= mynumber && mynumber > 3) {
      cat("First condition TRUE and second TRUE\n")
      a <- a^2
      b <- seq(1,a,length=mynumber)
    } else if (a <= mynumber && mynumber <= 3) {
      cat("First condition TRUE and second FALSE\n")
      a <- a^2
      b <- a^(3 - mynumber)
    } else if (mynumber >= 4) {
      cat("First condition FALSE and second TRUE\n")
      a <- a - 3.5
      b <- a^(3 - mynumber)
    } else {
      cat("First condition FALSE and second FALSE\n")
      a <- a - 3.5
      b <- rep(a + mynumber, times=3)
    }
    a
    b
  #+end_src

- Let's run this twice as before to see if we get the same results:
  #+begin_src R
    a <- 3
    mynumber <- 4
    <<stacked>>
    a <- 6
    mynumber <- 4
    <<stacked>>
  #+end_src

* The ~switch~ function for ~character~ strings

- If you need to choose code based on the value of a single object,
  you can use a series of stacked ~if~ statements.

- Example: assign a ~numeric~ value to ~foo~ where the number depends on
  the value of ~mystring~:
  #+name: simpsons
  #+begin_src R :results silent
    if ( mystring == "Homer" ) {
      foo <- 12
    } else if ( mystring == "Marge" ) {
      foo <- 34
    } else if ( mystring == "Bart" ) {
      foo <- 56
    } else if ( mystring == "Lisa" ) {
      foo <- 78
    } else if ( mystring == "Maggie") {
      foo <- 90
    } else {
      foo <- NA
    }
    foo
  #+end_src

- Example runs:
  #+begin_src R
    mystring <- "Lisa"    # matched with foo = 78
    <<simpsons>>
    mystring <- "Peter"   # not in the list
    <<simpsons>>
  #+end_src

- The ~switch~ function behaves like a set of stacked ~if~
  statements. Take a look at ~help(switch)~ to see its definition.

- Using the "Simpsons" example from before:
  #+name: switch
  #+begin_src R
    foo <- switch(
      EXPR = mystring,
      Homer=12,
      Marge=34,
      Bart=56,
      Lisa=78,
      Maggie=90,
      NA)
    foo
  #+end_src

- Example runs:
    #+begin_src R
    mystring <- "Lisa"    # matched with foo = 78
    <<switch>>
    mystring <- "Peter"   # not in the list
    <<switch>>
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] 78
  : [1] NA

- The first argument ~EXPR~ can be ~numeric~ or a ~character~ string

- The remaining arguments provide the values or operations based on
  the value of ~EXPR~. 

* ~switch~ for ~integer~ expressions

- If ~EXPR~ is an ~integer~, the outcome is determined purely with
  /positional matching/:
  #+name: iswitch
  #+begin_src R 
    foo <- switch(EXPR=mynum,12,34,56,78,NA)
    foo
  #+end_src

- In the code, every other value for ~mynum~ than 1,2,3,4 will set ~foo~
  to ~NULL~, the "null" object (value is undefined).
  #+begin_src R
    class(NULL)
  #+end_src

- Examples:
  #+begin_src R
    mynum <- 3
    <<iswitch>>
    mynum <- 0
    <<iswitch>>
    mynum <- 100
    <<iswitch>>
  #+end_src

[fn:1] In the code block, ~<<nested>>~ inserts the named code block
(~#+name: nested~) and runs it. This is achieved with the =:noweb yes=
flag in the =#+PROPERTY:= header of the Org-mode file. Alternatively,
you could define the =if= block as a function.

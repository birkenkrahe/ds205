* Objectives

This course continues the journey into data science begun in DSC 105
using both the R and Python programming languages. It includes writing
functions, natural language processing, importing and exporting data,
cleaning data, and working on the command line. Student projects cover
R packages and Python libraries as part of an interactive session.

* Student learning outcomes

Students who complete DSC 205, "Introduction to advanced data
science", will be able to:

- Import data into R and Python, store and transform them for analysis
- Visualize data as part of advanced explorative data analysis
- Understand basic predictive modeling strategies and methods
- Master statistical programming in R and Python
- Master the infrastructure for advanced statistical computing
- Know how to effectively present assignment results
- Be ready for advanced data science courses like data
  visualization (DSC 302) and machine learning (DSC 305)
- Research and present a capstone project 
- Apply the agile Scrum methodology to project management

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites (2024 catalog): DSC 105 (intro to data science)
or CSC 100/115/109 (intro to programming). May be waived if relevant
knowledge can be demonstrated.

Introductory knowledge of R as taught in DSC 105 or obtained
independently by completing the DataCamp online course “Introduction
to R” and "Python for R Users", and "Introduction to Python", or
“fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!”  (chapters 1-15 only, freely
available on GitHub). For R: Davies, The Book of R (NoStarch, 2016,
Part I only). For Python: Matthes, Python Crash Course (NoStarch,
2023, Chapter 1-7), Basic R and Python concepts are repeated and
practiced at the start of the term.

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION                 | IMPACT |
|---------+-----------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | DataCamp assignments        |    25% |
| Monthly | Sprint review presentations |    25% |
| Weekly  | Tests                       |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam                  |    25% |

Notes:
- To pass: 60% of all available points.
- DataCamp assignments: there are 16 assignments spread out over 4
  courses. Each assignment contributes 1.5625% (25/15) to your final
  grade. Late assignments are counted as 50% complete only.
- Sprint review presentations: a customer-focused team effort
  resulting in a project presentation, with 4 Scrum sprint reviews.
- Tests: weekly online quizzes, which are previewed and reviewed in
  class.
- Final exam: selection of the most challenging weekly quiz questions.
- You only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your
  grade at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below
  your final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.
- There will be bonus programming assignments to make up for other
  categories.
  
* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter grades. for
the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs, while for the
term results, only straight letters are given (by rounding up). This
table is also used in Canvas to compute your grades. Transitions
between letter grades are rounded (e.g. 89.5% to 90%).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE*    |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 59.5% to 0%    | F (FAILED)       |

* Schedule and session content

For *important dates*, see the 2023-2024 Academic Calendar at:
[[https://catalog.lyon.edu/202324-academic-calendar][catalog.lyon.edu.]]

Lectures and lab sessions are aligned with the content of the 10
DataCamp lessons that need to be completed in the course of the
term. Short introductions to text mining, machine learning, and data
science on the command line are included, time permitting.

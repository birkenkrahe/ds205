* Problem
Can you turn this =while= loop discussed in class into a =for= loop? The
problem was to calculate the average flow of the river =Nile= until
the flow drops below a ~threshold~:
#+begin_src R
  ## Initialize variables
  threshold <- 900
  total_flow <- 0
  year_count <- 0
  i <- 1

  ## Loop through dataset until a flow less than 800 is found
  while (Nile[i] >= threshold) {
    total_flow <- total_flow + Nile[i]
    year_count <- year_count + 1
    i <- i + 1
  }

  ## calculate average flow up to the found year
  average_flow <- total_flow / year_count

  ## print results
  cat("Years until encountering a flow less than", threshold,":", year_count, "\n")
  cat("Average flow up to that year:", average_flow, "\n")
#+end_src

* Solution 1: looping via vector index values

#+begin_src R
  ## Initialize variables
  ...

  ## Loop through dataset until a flow less than threshold is found
  ...

  ## calculate average flow up to the found year
  ...

  ## calculate and print results

#+end_src

* Solution 2:looping via loop index (vector values)

#+begin_src R
    ## Initialize variables

    ## Loop through dataset until a flow less than threshold is found

    ## calculate average flow up to the found year

    ## calculate and print results

  #+end_src

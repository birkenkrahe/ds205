** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/MDPI_2023_BIRKENKRAHE_poster.pptx.png]]

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

** 10 top tips: How to study programming languages

...when using DataCamp and/or when reviewing a test:

1) Read the texts and the instructions carefully.
2) Take notes if you can.
3) Recreate all code in your IDE before submitting it.
4) This will take at least twice as long as you expect.
5) You will learn a lot of extras along the way.
6) Your programmer's muscle memory will be improved.
7) Look at the classroom material to identify overlaps.
8) Look stuff up in books or in online documentation.
9) Review DataCamp lessons daily using practice questions.
10) Review tests monthly by completing them again.

* DONE Week 2: Conditionals and work flow in R & work environment
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/datascientist.png]]

Starting this week, project a more powerful data scientist profile!
New Year's resolution: look as fit and fierce as the guy in the photo!

- [X] Review: DataCamp lesson "Conditionals and control flow" in R
- [X] New content: Fun facts!
- [ ] Review: Entry test Python/R (practice sheet) & Emacs exercise

** DataCamp review questions

(AI-generated from the lesson slides):

1. What are relational operators in R and give an example?
   #+begin_notes
   Relational operators are used to compare values in R. An example is
   the equality operator ~==~, which checks if two values are
   equal. For instance, ~TRUE == TRUE~ evaluates to ~TRUE~.
   #+end_notes

2. How does the inequality operator work in R? Provide an example.
   #+begin_notes
   The inequality operator ~!=~ in R checks if two values are not
   equal. For example, ~TRUE != FALSE~ evaluates to ~TRUE~, indicating
   that the two values are indeed different.
   #+end_notes

   #+begin_src R
     TRUE != FALSE
   #+end_src

3. Can relational operators be used with vectors in R? Give an
   example.
   #+begin_notes
   Yes, relational operators can be applied to vectors in R. For
   example, if ~linkedin~ is a vector ~(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)~, the
   expression ~linkedin > 10~ would return a vector of logical values
   indicating whether each element in ~linkedin~ is greater than 10.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
     linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
     linkedin > 10
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

4. What are the logical operators in R and how do they work?
   #+begin_notes
   The logical operators in R include AND (~&~), OR (~|~), and NOT
   (~!~). The AND operator returns ~TRUE~ if both operands are true, the
   OR operator returns ~TRUE~ if at least one operand is true, and the
   NOT operator negates the truth value of its operand. For example,
   ~TRUE & FALSE~ evaluates to ~FALSE~, ~TRUE | FALSE~ to ~TRUE~, and ~!TRUE~ to
   ~FALSE~.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
     c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE)  & c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
     c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE) && c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
   : [1] FALSE
   : Warning messages:
   : 1: In c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) :
   :   'length(x) = 3 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)'
   : 2: In c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) :
   :   'length(x) = 3 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)'

5. How do you write a conditional statement in R?
   #+begin_notes
   A conditional statement in R can be written using ~if~, ~else if~, and
   ~else~ clauses. For example, ~if (x < 0) { print("x is a negative
   number") } else { print("x is either a positive number or zero") }~
   will print a message based on the value of ~x~.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
     x <- 0
     if (x < 0) {
       print("x is a negative number")
     } else {
       print("x is either a positive number or zero")
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "x is either a positive number or zero"

** Given any thought to your projects?

You'll have to present your proposal in 3 weeks!

What are you leaning towards?
- Packages that help me work with hospital birth data
- Packages that help me analyse video game player data
- Packages that help analyse financial data especially stocks

What will you need to do?
- Identify an interesting package
- Find data to experiment with
- What makes it special or unique?
- How would you apply it? ("Use cases")
- Comparing with other (similar) packages
- Who uses this package?
- How easy is it to use it?
- Is it beginner-friendly is it?
- What should you never use it for? (Performance, maintenance, data)
- Does it lend itself to an interactive exercise?
- If it's an R/Python packages, is there an Python/R equivalent

** Fun facts
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/funfact.png]]

R:
#+begin_notes
R was named partly after its (NZ) creators, Ross Ihaka and Robert
Gentleman, which also playfully hints at its predecessors, S and
S-PLUS languages. Another fun fact: I've lived in NZ.
#+end_notes

And also: how can you check/change your working directory in R?
#+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
  ## Change the working directory to 'path_to_new_directory'
  setwd('path_to_new_directory')

  ## To confirm the current working directory has been changed, you can use getwd()
  print(getwd())
#+end_src

Python:
#+begin_notes
Python was named after the British comedy sQeries "Monty Python's
Flying Circus," not the snake. Its creator, Guido van Rossum, was a
fan of the show and wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly
mysterious.
#+end_notes

And also: how can you check/change your working directory in Python?
#+begin_src python :results output :session *Python* :exports both :noweb yes
  import os

  # Change the working directory to 'path_to_new_directory'
  os.chdir('path_to_new_directory')

  # To confirm the current working directory has been changed, you can use getcwd()
  print("Current Working Directory: ", os.getcwd())
#+end_src

** What happened on Monday? review

1. 3 things you want to do with data?
   #+begin_notes
   EDA = Exploratory Data Analysis
   - View data (read and open in R or Python)
   - Import data (download and import to R or Python)
   - Analyse data (clean and transform for example scale)
   #+end_notes

2. How should you upload files to Emacs (from the web)?
   #+begin_notes
   With the built-in eww browser (~M-x eww~)
   #+end_notes

3. What are we looking for in raw data?
   #+begin_notes
   - Does the file have a header?
   - What data types are present? (numeric or string)
   - How are decimals represented?  (Comma or point)
   - Are there missing values? (~NA~ in R, ~NaN~ in Python)
   #+end_notes

4. Which packages are loaded in R?
   #+begin_notes
   - With the ~search()~ function
   #+end_notes

5. How do you load a package into R and Python?
   #+begin_notes
   - Python: ~import~ or ~from [pkg] import [function]~
   - R: ~library("[pkg]")~
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R
     search()  ## there's no MASS package loaded
     library("MASS")  ## loads the MASS package
     search() ## now the package is loaded
   #+end_src

   6. What happens when you first start R on any given day?
   #+begin_notes
   - Emacs ask you where you want to start the R console
   - The R console (~*R*~) will be a separate buffer
   - It runs in the background
   - Python does not need an explicit confirmation
   #+end_notes

7. What types of function parameters are there and how do they differ?
   #+begin_notes
   For example ~read.csv~ # check the help ~?read.csv~ or ~args~
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R
     args(read.csv)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : function (file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"", dec = ".",
   :     fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...)
   : NULL

   If you've forgotten everything except 'read', use ~??~:
   #+begin_src R
     ??read
   #+end_src

** Bonus exercise until Monday

Here is a [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2111/assignments/24871][bonus exercise]] for extra points until the next session:
#+begin_quote
In the R and Python review that we've been working on, the dataset
contains missing value and one record (with the ID 2190) that belongs
to a test user and needs to be removed.

Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to transform the
dataset into a data frame where the last row (for the test user) is
deleted.

Next, compute the arithmetic average (`mean`) for test 1, for test 2,
and for test 1 and test 2. Make sure that the missing values are not
part of the averaging (they're not 0 values!).

Do this in R and in Python. Simply continue the file that you've been
working in and submit it here as an Org-mode file. You have to meet
the deadline for these bonus points because we're going to discuss the
solution on Monday.
#+end_quote

* DONE Week 5: +Writing functions in R+ Transforming pandas DataFrame in Python
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/overworked.png]]

Overworked? Overloaded with mastering R and Python?

Never fear! Help is near!

** Emacs special
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[../img/guinea_pigs.png]]

If you're working with code blocks, you want to Amake your life easier:
1) add to ~org-tempo-keyword-alist~ (e.g. ~<S~ for startup, ~<H~ for images)
2) add to ~org-structure-template-alist~ (e.g. ~<p~ for python, ~<sqlite~
   for sqlite, ~<cc~ for C, ~<cpp~ for C++, ~<r~ for R code blocks, etc.)
3) Begin by looking these Emacs Lisp variables up: ~C-h v~ + variable
   name.
4) You can use ~C-h~ also to check key bindings (~k~) or functions (~f~).

** DataCamp assignment changes

- You're finished with Intermediate Python today (for now)
- What remains is logic & loops (will do that later)
- You're starting on functions in R now (because it's easy)
- The last chapter of "[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-r][Intermediate R]]" (utilities) is a bonus.
- We'll continue looking at plots in R and Python all of next week.
- We'll use function definitions from R and Python for that.
- There will be small bonus exercises - double points for R and Python

* DONE Week 6: Transforming dataframes in R and getting summary statistics
#+attr_html: :width 400px:

- Use the whole time! The student with 90% used 60 min, the student
  with 85% used 30 min, and the student with 60% used 15 minutes!

** Transformation of data frames in R (code along)

*Review questions (Python):*

1) You know how to check for missing values in a =numpy= array and in a
   =pandas= data frame.
   #+begin_example python
     pd.isna(np.nan)
     np.isnan(np.nan)
   #+end_example
2) You know how to create a flag vector for the ~'ID'~ column of a
   dataframe ~df~, e.g. to check if ID < 10.
   #+begin_example python
     df.ID < 10
   #+end_example
3) You know how to use the flag vector to extract data frame values.
   #+begin_example python
     idx = df.ID < 10
     df[idx]
   #+end_example
4) You know how to get the indices of the data frame elements that
   satisfy the flag condition.
   #+begin_example python
     np.where(df['ID'] < 10)[0]
   #+end_example
5) You know how to get data frame structure information.
   #+begin_example python
     df.info()
     df.dtypes
   #+end_example
6) You know how to check if any data frame rows of the ID column
   satisfy the condition to be < 10.
   #+begin_example python
     any(df['ID'] < 10)
   #+end_example
7) You know how to check the top or the bottom of a data frame ~df~.
   #+begin_example
     df.head()
     df.tail()
   #+end_example

Now, load the code along file and code along for the remainder of this
session on transforming data frames - with R:

6) What's the structure of the contingency table?
   #+begin_src R
     tbl <- table(foo)
     str(tbl) # integer values `as.integer(tbl)` and `names(tbl)`
     as.integer(tbl) # numeric integer vector
     names(tbl)  # character vector
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_src R :file bar.png :session *R* :results output graphics file :exports both :noweb yes
     barplot(height = tbl)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

     ## method 1
     <<     df1 <- as.data.frame(tbl)
     colnames(df1) <- c('values','frequencies')
     df1

     ## method 2
     df2 <- data.frame('values'=names(tbl),'frequencies'=as.integer(tbl))
     df2
   #+end_src

  apply), scoping, arguments, if-else conditional statements

- *DataCamp deadlines* changed and *bonus lesson* added (see [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2111][Canvas]])

- Any questions on the upcoming literature ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2111/assignments/26166][2nd sprint]]) review?

- Quick question: do you need to reference software in your work? If
  you do it, how would you do that? ([[https://libguides.ecu.edu/c.php?g=1145002&p=8359973][Example]])


** Bonus: vectorized condition checks in Python

- In R, you need the function =ifelse= to test a condition for a
  vector. In Python, you can use the =all= function:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    x = [1,2,3,4,5]  # vector definition

    ## selection statement
    if all(i < 5 for i in x):
        print("All elements in the vector are less than 5")
    else:
        print("Some elements in the vector are not less than 5")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Some elements in the vector are not less than 5


** Test preview and DataCamp review

1. What does the =sapply= function do? Can you think of an example?
   #+begin_src R
     sapply(X=1:4, FUN=sqrt)  # returns a vector
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000

2. What are the alternatives to =sapply=?
   #+begin_src R
     for (x in 1:4) print(sqrt(x)) # for loop
     unlist(lapply(X=1:4, FUN=sqrt)) # lapply
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 1
   : [1] 1.414214
   : [1] 1.732051
   : [1] 2
   : [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000

3. Which of the following function calls will work for the function
   ~hello~ defined below, and what will the output be?
   #+name: hello_function
   #+begin_src R :results silent
     ## function definition
     hello <- function(x=TRUE,y) {
       if(x) {
         paste("Hello",y)
       } else {
         print("Hello world")
       }
     }
   #+end_src

   Function calls:
   - ~hello("Marcus")~  - won't work (positional arg in wrong position)
   - ~hello(y="Marcus")~ - works because arg is exact and 1st arg has default 
   - ~hello(100,"Marcus")~  - x becomes 100 (TRUE) so it works
   - ~hello(FALSE)~ - works because y (NA) is never used!
   - ~hello(FALSE,"Marcus")~ - prints hello world (y never used)
   - ~hello(T)~  - error because y is needed and missing

   #+begin_src R
     <<hello_function>>
     hello(T)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Error in paste("Hello", y) : argument "y" is missing, with no default

4. What is an anonymous function?
   #+begin_src R
     sapply(X = 1:10,
            FUN = function(x) x^2) # function without a name
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :  [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100

5. What does =vapply= do?
   #+begin_src R
     vapply(X = list(1,2,"3"),
            FUN = is.numeric,   # tests if X is numeric or not
            FUN.VALUE = logical(1) # expected output type
            )
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

6. How can you check which arguments are mandatory, e.g. for =barplot=?
   #+begin_src R
     args(barplot)  # or call up the complete help with ?
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : function (height, ...) 
   : NULL

7. What do the functions =all= and =any= do?
   #+begin_src R
     foo <- c(1,0,1,1,1)
     all(foo == 1)   # are all elements of foo equal 1?
     any(foo == 0)   # are any elements of foo equal 0?
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] FALSE
   : [1] TRUE

8. What happens when you pass a vector to the condition of an =if=
   statement?
   #+begin_src R
     bar <- 5:10
     if(bar<6) print("OK")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "OK"
   : Warning message:
   : In if (bar < 6) print("OK") :
   :   the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

9. Can you use =ifelse= to replace =NA= values in a vector with =0= values?
   #+begin_src R
     x <- c(1,2,NA,4)

     ifelse(test = is.na(x),   # tests if x is missing (NA)
            yes  = 0,
            no   = x)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 1 2 0 4
   
10. What are =&&= and =||= used for?
    #+begin_src R
      if (F || T) print("TRUE") # will print because F OR T == TRUE
      if (T && T) print("TRUE again") # will print because T AND T == TRUE
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] "TRUE"
    : [1] "TRUE again"

* Week 11: Switch and loops and R
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[../img/week_11.png]]

/AI image prompt: programmers celebrating Easter./

- Easter egg: deadlines stretched to their limits!

** DONE Review and preview: nested (or stacked) =if= and =else= statement
*** Nested 
Write a =function= called ~nested_if~ that takes 2 arguments and checks if
one is smaller than the other and prints the findings. Call the
function with the arguments 1,2 and 2,1.

Solution:
#+begin_src R
  nested_if <- function(a,b) {
    if (a < b) {
      print("first number is is smaller than second number")
    } else {
      print("first number is greater or equal than second number")
    }
  } 

  nested_if(1,2)
  nested_if(2,1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "first number is is smaller than second number"
: [1] "first number is greater or equal than second number"

Another solution with =ifelse=
#+begin_src R

#+end_src

*** Stacked
What if you wanted to check if the two numbers were equal?
#+begin_quote
Answer: you could replace the =else= by an =else if= followed by an
=else=. This is what is called "stacked" rather than "nested".

Example:
#+begin_example
  if (condition) {
     do something
     } else if (condition) {
         do something
     } else {
         do something
     }
#+end_example

#+end_quote

Implement this and add a call to the modified ~nested_if~ with 2,2.

Solution:
#+begin_src R
  nested_if <- function(a,b)
  {
    if (a < b) {
      print("first number is is smaller than second number")
    } else if (a==b) {
      print("first number is equal to second number")
    } else {
      print("first number is greater or equal than second number")
    }
  } 

  nested_if(1,2)
  nested_if(2,1)
  nested_if(2,2)  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "first number is is smaller than second number"
: [1] "first number is greater or equal than second number"
: [1] "first number is equal to second number"

*** Switched

Can you rewrite the last result as a =switch= statement?
#+begin_quote
Answer: you could couple it with =ifelse= to define the three outcomes
"less", "equal", and "greater". 
#+end_quote

Solution:
#+begin_src R
  nested_switch <- function(a, b) {
    ## Define the comparison result as a character string
    comparison_result <- ifelse(a < b, "less", ifelse(a == b, "equal", "greater"))

    ## Use switch to select the action based on comparison_result
    message <- switch(comparison_result,
                      "less" = "first number is smaller than second number\n",
                      "equal" = "first number is equal to second number\n",
                      "greater" = "first number is greater than second number\n",
                      "Unexpected condition") # Default case, though it should not be reached

    cat(message)

  }
  nested_switch(1,2)
  nested_switch(2,1)
  nested_switch(2,2)
  nested_switch(Inf,Inf)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: first number is smaller than second number
: first number is greater than second number
: first number is equal to second number
: first number is equal to second number


** TODO New bonus assignment "nesting complex if statements" (Canvas)

** TODO Review =switch=

1) What does =switch= replace to make code cleaner looking and more
   efficient?
   #+begin_quote
   A set of stacked =if= ... =else= statements.
   #+end_quote
2) Which =switch= statements are there in R?
   #+begin_src R
     ## There is no 'default' case unlike in C
     print(switch (2,"foo","bar",NA))     # switch integer
     print(switch("B","R"=1,"G"=2,"B"=3))  # switch character
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "bar"
   : [1] 3
3) When is the =default= case used in a =switch= statement?
   #+begin_quote
   There is no 'default'.
   #+end_quote

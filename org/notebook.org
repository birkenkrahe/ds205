** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/MDPI_2023_BIRKENKRAHE_poster.pptx.png]]

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

** 10 top tips: How to study programming languages

...when using DataCamp and/or when reviewing a test:

1) Read the texts and the instructions carefully.
2) Take notes if you can.
3) Recreate all code in your IDE before submitting it.
4) This will take at least twice as long as you expect.
5) You will learn a lot of extras along the way.
6) Your programmer's muscle memory will be improved.
7) Look at the classroom material to identify overlaps.
8) Look stuff up in books or in online documentation.
9) Review DataCamp lessons daily using practice questions.
10) Review tests monthly by completing them again.

* DONE Week 2: Conditionals and work flow in R & work environment
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/datascientist.png]]

Starting this week, project a more powerful data scientist profile!
New Year's resolution: look as fit and fierce as the guy in the photo!

- [X] Review: DataCamp lesson "Conditionals and control flow" in R
- [X] New content: Fun facts!
- [ ] Review: Entry test Python/R (practice sheet) & Emacs exercise

** DataCamp review questions

(AI-generated from the lesson slides):

1. What are relational operators in R and give an example?
   #+begin_notes
   Relational operators are used to compare values in R. An example is
   the equality operator ~==~, which checks if two values are
   equal. For instance, ~TRUE == TRUE~ evaluates to ~TRUE~.
   #+end_notes

2. How does the inequality operator work in R? Provide an example.
   #+begin_notes
   The inequality operator ~!=~ in R checks if two values are not
   equal. For example, ~TRUE != FALSE~ evaluates to ~TRUE~, indicating
   that the two values are indeed different.
   #+end_notes

   #+begin_src R
     TRUE != FALSE
   #+end_src

3. Can relational operators be used with vectors in R? Give an
   example.
   #+begin_notes
   Yes, relational operators can be applied to vectors in R. For
   example, if ~linkedin~ is a vector ~(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)~, the
   expression ~linkedin > 10~ would return a vector of logical values
   indicating whether each element in ~linkedin~ is greater than 10.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
     linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
     linkedin > 10
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

4. What are the logical operators in R and how do they work?
   #+begin_notes
   The logical operators in R include AND (~&~), OR (~|~), and NOT
   (~!~). The AND operator returns ~TRUE~ if both operands are true, the
   OR operator returns ~TRUE~ if at least one operand is true, and the
   NOT operator negates the truth value of its operand. For example,
   ~TRUE & FALSE~ evaluates to ~FALSE~, ~TRUE | FALSE~ to ~TRUE~, and ~!TRUE~ to
   ~FALSE~.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
     c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE)  & c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
     c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE) && c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
   : [1] FALSE
   : Warning messages:
   : 1: In c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) :
   :   'length(x) = 3 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)'
   : 2: In c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) :
   :   'length(x) = 3 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)'

5. How do you write a conditional statement in R?
   #+begin_notes
   A conditional statement in R can be written using ~if~, ~else if~, and
   ~else~ clauses. For example, ~if (x < 0) { print("x is a negative
   number") } else { print("x is either a positive number or zero") }~
   will print a message based on the value of ~x~.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
     x <- 0
     if (x < 0) {
       print("x is a negative number")
     } else {
       print("x is either a positive number or zero")
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "x is either a positive number or zero"

** Given any thought to your projects?

You'll have to present your proposal in 3 weeks!

What are you leaning towards?
- Packages that help me work with hospital birth data
- Packages that help me analyse video game player data
- Packages that help analyse financial data especially stocks

What will you need to do?
- Identify an interesting package
- Find data to experiment with
- What makes it special or unique?
- How would you apply it? ("Use cases")
- Comparing with other (similar) packages
- Who uses this package?
- How easy is it to use it?
- Is it beginner-friendly is it?
- What should you never use it for? (Performance, maintenance, data)
- Does it lend itself to an interactive exercise?
- If it's an R/Python packages, is there an Python/R equivalent

** Fun facts
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/funfact.png]]

R:
#+begin_notes
R was named partly after its (NZ) creators, Ross Ihaka and Robert
Gentleman, which also playfully hints at its predecessors, S and
S-PLUS languages. Another fun fact: I've lived in NZ.
#+end_notes

And also: how can you check/change your working directory in R?
#+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
  ## Change the working directory to 'path_to_new_directory'
  setwd('path_to_new_directory')

  ## To confirm the current working directory has been changed, you can use getwd()
  print(getwd())
#+end_src

Python:
#+begin_notes
Python was named after the British comedy sQeries "Monty Python's
Flying Circus," not the snake. Its creator, Guido van Rossum, was a
fan of the show and wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly
mysterious.
#+end_notes

And also: how can you check/change your working directory in Python?
#+begin_src python :results output :session *Python* :exports both :noweb yes
  import os

  # Change the working directory to 'path_to_new_directory'
  os.chdir('path_to_new_directory')

  # To confirm the current working directory has been changed, you can use getcwd()
  print("Current Working Directory: ", os.getcwd())
#+end_src

** What happened on Monday? review

1. 3 things you want to do with data?
   #+begin_notes
   EDA = Exploratory Data Analysis
   - View data (read and open in R or Python)
   - Import data (download and import to R or Python)
   - Analyse data (clean and transform for example scale)
   #+end_notes

2. How should you upload files to Emacs (from the web)?
   #+begin_notes
   With the built-in eww browser (~M-x eww~)
   #+end_notes

3. What are we looking for in raw data?
   #+begin_notes
   - Does the file have a header?
   - What data types are present? (numeric or string)
   - How are decimals represented?  (Comma or point)
   - Are there missing values? (~NA~ in R, ~NaN~ in Python)
   #+end_notes

4. Which packages are loaded in R?
   #+begin_notes
   - With the ~search()~ function
   #+end_notes

5. How do you load a package into R and Python?
   #+begin_notes
   - Python: ~import~ or ~from [pkg] import [function]~
   - R: ~library("[pkg]")~
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R
     search()  ## there's no MASS package loaded
     library("MASS")  ## loads the MASS package
     search() ## now the package is loaded
   #+end_src

   6. What happens when you first start R on any given day?
   #+begin_notes
   - Emacs ask you where you want to start the R console
   - The R console (~*R*~) will be a separate buffer
   - It runs in the background
   - Python does not need an explicit confirmation
   #+end_notes

7. What types of function parameters are there and how do they differ?
   #+begin_notes
   For example ~read.csv~ # check the help ~?read.csv~ or ~args~
   #+end_notes   
   #+begin_src R
     args(read.csv)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : function (file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"", dec = ".", 
   :     fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...) 
   : NULL

   If you've forgotten everything except 'read', use ~??~:
   #+begin_src R
     ??read
   #+end_src

** Bonus exercise until Monday

Here is a [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2111/assignments/24871][bonus exercise]] for extra points until the next session:
#+begin_quote
In the R and Python review that we've been working on, the dataset
contains missing value and one record (with the ID 2190) that belongs
to a test user and needs to be removed.

Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to transform the
dataset into a data frame where the last row (for the test user) is
deleted.

Next, compute the arithmetic average (`mean`) for test 1, for test 2,
and for test 1 and test 2. Make sure that the missing values are not
part of the averaging (they're not 0 values!).

Do this in R and in Python. Simply continue the file that you've been
working in and submit it here as an Org-mode file. You have to meet
the deadline for these bonus points because we're going to discuss the
solution on Monday.
#+end_quote


* Week 5: +Writing functions in R+ Transforming and plotting in R and Python
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/overworked.png]]

Overworked? Overloaded with mastering R and Python?

Never fear! Help is near! 

** Emacs special

If you're working with code blocks, you want to make your life easier:
1) add to ~org-tempo-keyword-alist~ (e.g. ~<S~ for startup, ~<H~ for images)
2) add to ~org-structure-template-alist~ (e.g. ~<p~ for python, ~<sqlite~
   for sqlite, ~<cc~ for C, ~<cpp~ for C++, ~<r~ for R code blocks, etc.)
3) Begin by looking these Emacs Lisp variables up: ~C-h v~ + variable
   name.
4) You can use ~C-h~ also to check key bindings (~k~) or functions (~f~).

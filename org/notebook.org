| Feature            | R                                                                  | Python                                                                 |
|--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Focus      | Statistical analysis and data visualization.                       | General-purpose programming with strong support for data analysis.     |
| Language Type      | Domain-specific language for statistics.                           | General-purpose programming language.                                  |
| Learning Curve     | Steeper for those not familiar with statistical analysis.          | Generally considered easier for beginners.                             |
| Community          | Strong in academia, statistics, and bioinformatics.                | Broad and diverse, strong in web development, AI, and data science.    |
| Data Analysis      | Excellent for complex statistical analyses.                        | Very good for data analysis with libraries like pandas and numpy.      |
| Data Visualization | Superior capabilities with ggplot2 and other packages.             | Good with libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.                       |
| Libraries          | Comprehensive libraries for statistics and plotting (e.g., dplyr). | Extensive libraries for various applications beyond data analysis.     |
| IDE Support        | RStudio is a powerful and popular IDE for R.                       | Multiple IDEs available, including Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm.       |
| Extensibility      | Can call Python, C, C++, and Fortran code.                         | Can call C, C++, and R code, among others.                             |
| Performance        | Generally slower than Python, but can be improved with Rcpp.       | Faster, with the ability to use Cython for performance-critical code.  |
| Deployment         | More challenging to deploy in production environments.             | Easier to deploy, with various frameworks and tools for deployment.    |
| Machine Learning   | Growing number of packages (e.g., caret, xgboost).                 | Extensive machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow). |
| Documentation      | Good, especially for statistical methods.                          | Extensive and often includes examples.                                 |
| Community Support  | Active forums and mailing lists.                                   | Very active communities on Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.                |

** DONE Individual term projects

- Identify a Python or R package that you explore during the term.
- 1st sprint: Identify research questions for the package.
- 2nd sprint: Develop an exploration and testing methodology.
- 3rd sprint: Summarize results with an abstract.
- 4th sprint: Present with interactive exercises.
- Submit Emacs Org-mode file and any other materials.
- Turn the project in an item for your resume portfolio!

** DONE Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

** DONE 10 top tips: How to study programming languages

...when using DataCamp and/or when reviewing a test:

1) Read the texts and the instructions carefully.
2) Take notes if you can.
3) Recreate all code in your IDE before submitting it.
4) This will take at least twice as long as you expect.
5) You will learn a lot of extras along the way.
6) Your programmer's muscle memory will be improved.
7) Look at the classroom material to identify overlaps.
8) Look stuff up in books or in online documentation.
9) Review DataCamp lessons daily using practice questions.
10) Review tests monthly by completing them again.

** Test review - base R & conversion to R

Python test results:
#+begin_src R :results output :session *R* :exports both :noweb yes
  paste("Python test average", mean(c(77.5, 97.5, 56.67)))
  paste("R test average", mean(c(75,80,55)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "Python test average 77.2233333333333"
: [1] "R test average 70"
